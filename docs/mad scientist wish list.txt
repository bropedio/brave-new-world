CANNOT RELEASE NEXT VERSION WITHOUT THESE

	Fractional Defense:		Damage taken from fractional damage is Power * (160-stam)/128
							
	Retort:					Balanced Retort discussed. Prolly increase Cover/Counter, self-heal, counters with Dispatch?
	
	Tools:					Autocrossbow's power is just straight 255, no Schematics

WOULD BE NICE, BUT NOT STRICTLY REQUIRED FOR RELEASE OF LOL NEW WORLD

	Heiji's Coin:			Cheats on Cover and Counter
	
	Rage:					Has stam-based chance of coming out of Rage 
								if Moogle Charm is equipped.
							Rage attacks may crit (natural crit rate, boosted by "critical rate up")
							
	Spd-rev-fill			Speed-based pre-fill of ATB after being revived
	
	Enemy regen				Can go over 255
	
UNDEVELOPED IDEAS

	Slots:					something, something, gains "Schematics" boost somewhere
							Really, just gains more slots later on?
							Deschain liked Joker. Could even just ... re-randomize Slots, lol
							
	Duncan:					Gives Gauntlent effect to physical Blitzes instead of giving Bum Rush
							MY END would be setting Bum Rush to lvl.30 capstone, 210 power
							
	Tools:					Something, something, Schematics boosts magic tools
							Schematics hidden ... somewhere
							Or just something something mag Edgar
							
	Counter-attack:			Tiered counter-attack, insted of stat-based?
							Spd-based counter-attack?
							
	Bro's SOS Idea:			SOS Remedy
							Image
							???
							Sir Newton Fig should like this. Could even change Terra's auto-morph
							pendant to use these instead of auto-haste and auto-regen
							
usME or Zone Doctor stuff, don't bother the asm coders
Some of this is developed ideas, some are undeveloped ideas
							
	?Radiant Gown?:			(temp) re-named to "Artist's Gown"
							Stats changes to Spd/Stam +5
							Resist Water
							--Spellcast rate up (use Veil)
							??MP+ 25%/50% ??
							
	Terra:					Carbunkl to MP+20 / Mag+1
							Zoneseek to MP+20 / Stam+1
							Tritotch to MP+40
							Gets the Mag/MP espers in WoB, instead of waiting until Tritoch
							
	?Healing:?				Alongside the nerfed Cure 2 and Cure 3 power (20 and 30 respectively)
							Raise MP costs to 24 and 48
							Raise RegenX MP cost to 64
							
	Boss:					More ways to encourage going dps against boss (higher regen? scripting?)
	
	?Mogoon?:				Mogoon Seal with half-turn item?
